ManimCE Intermediate Course
========================================


**Welcome to Manim Intermediate Course!**

In this course it is assumed that you have the basis of ManimCE, if you **do not** you can take the basic course `here <https://www.devtaoism.com/p/intro-to-manim>`_.

For most of the course we will be using Jupyter-Notebook, you need to put this at the top of your jupyter file for it to work properly:

.. code:: python

    from manim import *

    config.media_embed = True
    config.media_width = "100%"

    _RV = "-v WARNING -qm --progress_bar None --disable_caching Example"
    _RI = "-v WARNING -s --progress_bar None --disable_caching Example"
